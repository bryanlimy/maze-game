# Maze Game
Implemented a simple maze game in Java

Our maze is a 2-dimensional grid. Each cell in this grid is either a
hallway or a wall. We denote a wall with the symbol X and an empty hallway with a blank space. There are
two players in this game — two monkeys. We denote them with symbols 1 and 2. The monkeys’ objective
is to eat as many bananas as possible. We denote bananas with the symbol B. Some bananas are stationary,
and some bananas move about the grid. We denote mobile bananas with the symbol M. Figure 1 (left) shows
an example initial state of the maze game. Notice the two players (1 and 2), four bananas (B), and two
mobile bananas (M).
